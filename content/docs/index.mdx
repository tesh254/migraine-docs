## Why Migraine?
Development teams often face common challenges:

- Complex setup procedures that need to be repeatedly executed
- Environment-specific configurations that must be carefully managed
- Multi-step deployment processes that are error-prone when done manually
- Team-wide consistency in development workflows
- Time lost in documentation and sharing of common procedures

Migraine addresses these challenges by allowing you to:

- Define workflows as code using simple JSON templates
- Share and version control your automation procedures
- Execute complex sequences of commands with built-in variable support
- Verify prerequisites before running critical operations
- Break down complex processes into discrete, manageable actions

Key Features

- **Template-Based Workflows**: Create reusable workflow templates that can be shared across your team
- **Variable Substitution**: Use dynamic variables in your workflows for flexible execution
- **Pre-flight Checks**: Ensure all prerequisites are met before workflow execution
- **Discrete Actions**: Define and execute specific parts of your workflow independently
- **Remote Templates**: Load workflow templates from URLs for easy sharing and distribution
- **Simple Syntax**: Use familiar JSON format for defining workflows
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both macOS and Linux systems

## Perfect For

- DevOps engineers automating deployment procedures
- Development teams standardizing environment setup
- System administrators managing repeated operations
- Anyone looking to automate complex command sequences

## Quick Example
- Here's a glimpse of how simple it is to use Migraine:

```bash
# Install Migraine
brew install migraine

# Create a new workflow from a template
migraine workflow new

# Run a workflow with variables
migraine run my_workflow -v PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/project

# Execute specific actions
migraine run my_workflow -a deploy
```
