## What is Migraine?

Migraine is a powerful CLI tool designed to eliminate the headaches of managing complex development workflows. It provides a robust framework for automating repetitive tasks, standardizing development environments, and streamlining deployment processes across teams.

## Why Migraine?

### The Problem

Development teams frequently encounter challenges that slow down productivity and introduce inconsistency:

- Complex setup procedures that need to be repeatedly executed
- Environment-specific configurations that must be carefully managed
- Multi-step deployment processes that are error-prone when done manually
- Lack of standardization across team workflows
- Time lost in documenting and sharing common procedures
- Difficulty in maintaining consistent development environments

### The Solution

Migraine addresses these challenges through:

#### üéØ Template-Based Workflows
Create reusable workflow templates that can be shared across your team, ensuring consistency and reducing setup time.

#### üîÑ Variable System
Use dynamic variables in your workflows for flexible execution across different environments and configurations.

#### ‚úÖ Pre-flight Checks
Ensure all prerequisites are met before workflow execution, preventing common setup issues before they occur.

#### üõ† Discrete Actions
Define and execute specific parts of your workflow independently, allowing for granular control and flexibility.

#### üåê Remote Templates
Load workflow templates from URLs for easy sharing and distribution across teams and organizations.
