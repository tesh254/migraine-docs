## Detailed Comparisons

### Migraine vs Shell Scripts

#### Shell Scripts
üëç Advantages:
- Universal availability
- No additional dependencies
- Full system access
- Maximum flexibility

üëé Disadvantages:
- No built-in templating
- Manual variable management
- Platform-specific syntax
- No standardized structure
- Error-prone
- Limited reusability

#### Migraine
üëç Advantages:
- Structured workflow definition
- Built-in variable management
- Pre-flight validation
- Template system
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Reusable components
- Standardized format

üëé Disadvantages:
- Additional tool to install
- Learning curve for syntax
- Less flexible than raw shell scripts

### Example Comparison

#### Shell Script Approach
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Manual variable definition
PROJECT_PATH=$1
DEPENDENCIES=$2

# Manual error checking
if [ -z "$PROJECT_PATH" ]; then
    echo "Error: PROJECT_PATH is required"
    exit 1
fi

# Manual directory check
if [ ! -d "$PROJECT_PATH" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$PROJECT_PATH"
fi

# Main logic
cd "$PROJECT_PATH" || exit
npm init -y
if [ -n "$DEPENDENCIES" ]; then
    npm install "$DEPENDENCIES"
fi
```

#### Migraine Approach
```json
{
  "name": "Node.js Setup",
  "pre_checks": [
    {
      "command": "test -d {{PROJECT_PATH}} || mkdir -p {{PROJECT_PATH}}",
      "description": "ensure project directory exists"
    }
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "command": "cd {{PROJECT_PATH}} && npm init -y",
      "description": "initialize project"
    },
    {
      "command": "cd {{PROJECT_PATH}} && npm install {{DEPENDENCIES}}",
      "description": "install dependencies"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Migraine vs Make

#### Make
üëç Advantages:
- Widely available
- Good for build systems
- Target dependency management
- Parallel execution

üëé Disadvantages:
- Complex syntax
- Limited template support
- No built-in variable validation
- Primarily focused on build processes

#### Migraine
üëç Advantages:
- Modern JSON-based syntax
- Built for workflow automation
- Strong variable management
- Remote template loading
- Pre-flight validation

üëé Disadvantages:
- Not designed for build systems
- No parallel execution
- Newer, smaller community

### Example Comparison

#### Makefile Approach
```makefile
PROJECT_PATH ?= .
DEPENDENCIES ?=

.PHONY: setup install

setup:
    mkdir -p $(PROJECT_PATH)
    cd $(PROJECT_PATH) && npm init -y

install:
    cd $(PROJECT_PATH) && npm install $(DEPENDENCIES)
```

#### Migraine Approach
```json
{
  "name": "Project Setup",
  "actions": {
    "setup": {
      "command": "mkdir -p {{PROJECT_PATH}} && cd {{PROJECT_PATH}} && npm init -y",
      "description": "initialize project"
    },
    "install": {
      "command": "cd {{PROJECT_PATH}} && npm install {{DEPENDENCIES}}",
      "description": "install dependencies"
    }
  }
}
```

### Migraine vs NPM Scripts

#### NPM Scripts
üëç Advantages:
- Integrated with Node.js projects
- Simple syntax
- Package.json integration
- Huge ecosystem

üëé Disadvantages:
- Limited to Node.js projects
- Basic script running
- No built-in templating
- Limited workflow control

#### Migraine
üëç Advantages:
- Language agnostic
- Advanced workflow control
- Template system
- Pre-flight checks
- Variable management

üëé Disadvantages:
- Separate tool installation
- Not integrated with package managers
- Additional configuration files

### Example Comparison

#### NPM Scripts Approach
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "mkdir -p $PROJECT_PATH && cd $PROJECT_PATH && npm init -y",
    "install-deps": "cd $PROJECT_PATH && npm install $DEPENDENCIES"
  }
}
```

#### Migraine Approach
```json
{
  "name": "Node.js Project Setup",
  "pre_checks": [
    {
      "command": "node --version",
      "description": "check node installation"
    }
  ],
  "actions": {
    "setup": {
      "command": "mkdir -p {{PROJECT_PATH}} && cd {{PROJECT_PATH}} && npm init -y",
      "description": "initialize project"
    },
    "install": {
      "command": "cd {{PROJECT_PATH}} && npm install {{DEPENDENCIES}}",
      "description": "install dependencies"
    }
  }
}
```
