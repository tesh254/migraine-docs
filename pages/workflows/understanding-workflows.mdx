In Migraine, workflows and templates serve different but complementary purposes. While templates are the blueprints, workflows are the concrete instances created from these templates with specific configurations and variable values.

## Templates vs. Workflows

### Templates
- Reusable blueprints
- Define structure and possible actions
- Contain variable placeholders
- Not directly executable
- Shared across team/organization

### Workflows
- Concrete instances of templates
- Contains actual variable values
- Directly executable
- Specific to a project/environment
- Stored locally for reuse

## Creating Workflows

Workflows are created from templates using the CLI:

```bash
# Create a new workflow
migraine workflow new

# List existing workflows
migraine workflow list

# Delete a workflow
migraine workflow delete workflow_id
```

## Workflow Lifecycle

### 1. Creation
```bash
migraine workflow new
```
During creation, you'll:
1. Select a template
2. Name your workflow
3. Provide variable values
4. Configure any specific settings

### 2. Usage
```bash
# Run entire workflow
migraine run workflow_id

# Run specific action
migraine run workflow_id -a action_name

# Run with variable override
migraine run workflow_id -v KEY=VALUE
```

### 3. Management
```bash
# List workflows
migraine workflow list

# Delete workflow
migraine workflow delete workflow_id
```

## Example: Template to Workflow

### Original Template
```json
{
  "name": "Node.js Project",
  "description": "Setup Node.js project",
  "steps": [
    {
      "command": "cd {{PROJECT_PATH}} && npm init -y",
      "description": "initialize project"
    },
    {
      "command": "cd {{PROJECT_PATH}} && npm install {{DEPENDENCIES}}",
      "description": "install dependencies"
    }
  ],
  "actions": {
    "start": {
      "command": "cd {{PROJECT_PATH}} && npm start",
      "description": "start application"
    }
  }
}
```

### Created Workflow
```json
{
  "id": "my_node_app",
  "name": "My Node App",
  "steps": [
    {
      "command": "cd /home/user/projects/my-app && npm init -y",
      "description": "initialize project"
    },
    {
      "command": "cd /home/user/projects/my-app && npm install express typescript",
      "description": "install dependencies"
    }
  ],
  "actions": {
    "start": {
      "command": "cd /home/user/projects/my-app && npm start",
      "description": "start application"
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Differences

### 1. Variable Resolution
- **Templates**: Contain variable placeholders (`{{VARIABLE_NAME}}`)
- **Workflows**: Contain resolved variable values

### 2. Storage
- **Templates**: Stored in template store, shareable
- **Workflows**: Stored locally in workflow store

### 3. Execution
- **Templates**: Cannot be executed directly
- **Workflows**: Can be run immediately

### 4. Scope
- **Templates**: Organization/team-wide
- **Workflows**: Project/environment specific

### 5. Reusability
- **Templates**: Designed for multiple uses
- **Workflows**: Configured for specific use

## Working with Workflows

### Running Workflows

#### Complete Workflow
```bash
# Run all steps in order
migraine run my_workflow
```

#### Specific Actions
```bash
# Run single action
migraine run my_workflow -a start

# Run multiple actions
migraine run my_workflow -a test -a lint
```

#### With Variable Overrides
```bash
# Override stored variables
migraine run my_workflow -v ENV=production -v PORT=3000
```

### Workflow Storage

Workflows are stored in:
- Location: `~/.mg_workflows/`
- Format: JSON files
- Naming: Based on workflow ID

## Common Workflow Patterns

### 1. Development Environment
```bash
# Create workflow from dev-env template
migraine workflow new
# Select dev-env template
# Set PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/project

# Start development environment
migraine run dev_env -a start

# Stop environment
migraine run dev_env -a stop
```

### 2. Deployment Pipeline
```bash
# Create from deployment template
migraine workflow new
# Select deploy template
# Set DEPLOY_ENV=production

# Run deployment
migraine run deploy -v VERSION=1.0.0
```

### 3. Database Operations
```bash
# Create from database template
migraine workflow new
# Select db-ops template
# Set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Run backup
migraine run db_ops -a backup

# Run restore
migraine run db_ops -a restore
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Organization
- Use clear, descriptive workflow IDs
- Group related workflows together
- Document workflow purpose and usage
- Keep workflows focused and specific

### 2. Variable Management
- Store commonly used variables
- Override variables only when needed
- Use environment-specific variables
- Handle sensitive data carefully

### 3. Workflow Maintenance
- Regularly review and update workflows
- Remove unused workflows
- Keep variable values current
- Test workflows periodically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Not Found**
```bash
# List all workflows
migraine workflow list

# Check workflow ID spelling
migraine run --help
```

2. **Action Not Found**
```bash
# List workflow details to see available actions
migraine workflow list
```

3. **Variable Errors**
```bash
# Check required variables
migraine workflow list

# Provide missing variables
migraine run workflow_id -v MISSING_VAR=value
```

### Runtime Issues

1. **Command Failures**
- Check variable values are correct
- Verify paths exist
- Ensure required tools are installed
- Check permissions

2. **Performance Issues**
- Review command timeouts
- Check resource usage
- Verify network connectivity
- Monitor disk space

## Migration and Backup

### Exporting Workflows
- Workflows are stored as JSON
- Can be version controlled
- Easily shareable between teams
- Portable between environments

### Backing Up Workflows
```bash
# Backup workflow directory
cp -r ~/.mg_workflows/ ~/workflow_backup/
```

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Chaining Workflows
```bash
# Create a script to run multiple workflows
#!/bin/bash
migraine run setup
migraine run deploy -v ENV=staging
migraine run test
```

### 2. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Migraine
        run: curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tesh254/migraine/main/install.sh | bash
      - name: Run Deployment
        run: migraine run deploy -v ENV=production
```
